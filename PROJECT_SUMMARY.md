## 💡 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
Your Google Sheet (Data)
         ↓
    Dashboard reads data every few minutes
         ↓
    Displays on interactive map
         ↓
    Community members see schedule
         ↓
    Partners see analytics
```

**No Server Required!**
- Google Sheets = Your database
- GitHub Pages = Free hosting
- JavaScript = Magic that connects them

---

## 📊 Understanding the Data Flow

### For Van Schedule:
1. Team member opens Google Sheet
2. Adds new row: date, time, location, services
3. Saves (auto-saves in Google Sheets)
4. Dashboard checks for updates (every 5 min)
5. New stop appears on map automatically
6. Community members see it on website

### For Service Tracking:
1. After a van stop, team records attendance
2. Adds to "Service Tracking" tab
3. Dashboard updates statistics
4. Partners see updated numbers
5. Monthly reports reflect new data

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What's Public:
- Van schedule (where/when)
- Services offered
- Aggregate statistics (total people served)
- Census tract data

### What's Private:
- Individual patient information (NEVER add to sheet)
- Medical records (NEVER add to sheet)
- Personal phone numbers (NEVER add to sheet)
- Specific diagnoses (NEVER add to sheet)

**This dashboard is HIPAA-compliant IF you follow privacy guidelines!**
